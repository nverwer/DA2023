# Declarative Diagrams With Mermaid <br> Nico Verwer, Declarative Amsterdam 2023

This repository contains the examples used for my presentation at [Declarative Amsterdam](https://declarative.amsterdam/) 2023. These are the files that start with 'example'.
You can view this in [Mermaid Live](https://mermaid.live/) or in Visual Studio Code with one of the Mermaid extensions like [MarkdownPreview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid).

It also contains the Javascript code to generate a call graph for a web component.
You can run this from a command prompt:
```
node generate-mermaid.js my-web-component.js
```
The generated Markdown+Mermaid code will be in `my-web-component.md`.
